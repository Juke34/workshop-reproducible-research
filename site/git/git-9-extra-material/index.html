			<p>The following extra material contains some more advanced things you can do with
Git and the command line in general, which is not part of the main course
materials. All the essential skills of Git are covered by the previous
sections; the material here should be considered tips and tricks from people
who use Git every day. You thus don't need to use these things unless you want
to, and you can even skip this part of the lesson if you like!</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about Git in general, here are some
reading tips for you:</p>

<h2 id="decorating-your-prompt">Decorating your prompt<a class="headerlink" href="#decorating-your-prompt" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>When you are working on the command line interface (CLI), you will usually have
some small pieces of information relating to your current directory, the name
of the computer or host you're working on, and so forth. You've probably
already seen your prompt while working with Git throughout this lesson, but
here's an example of what one might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">erikfmbp:~/teaching/workshop-reproducible-research erik.fasterius $
</code></pre>
<p>The above prompt contains the name of the computer, a colon, the current
working directory, the username and a dollar-sign; it is stored in the
variable <code>PS1</code>. You can type <code>echo $PS1</code> to see what variables your prompt
is made up of; the above example contains <code>\h:\W \u\$</code>, where <code>\h</code> is the
hostname, <code>\W</code> the working directory and <code>\u</code> the username.</p>
<p>Some people like to also show the current branch on their prompt, thus avoiding
having to type <code>git branch</code> continuously. There are several ways you might do
this, and we're only presenting one of them here: a bash function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git_branch() {
     git branch 2&gt; /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
</code></pre>
<p>This function does a number of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ejects the error message from Git if the current directory isn't a part of a
   Git repository into <code>/dev/null</code> (<em>i.e.</em> into nothing).</li>
<li>Find the current branch by searching for a line that starts with <code>*</code> (<em>i.e.</em>
   the current branch) using the command line program <code>sed</code>.</li>
<li>Put the current branch into parentheses with a space before it.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can then build our new prompt by adding this function into it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># The first part of the old prompt
PS1='\h:\W \u'

# Add the Git branch
PS1=$PS1'$(git_branch)'

# Add the last part of the old prompt
PS1=$PS1' \$'
</code></pre>
<p>Now you should see the current Git branch on your prompt! The only problem now
is that this only works for your current session: once you restart your CLI
you'll have to re-define your prompt again. This can be circumvented, though.
What you need to do is to add the code defining your prompt into your so-called
bash profile: <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. Every time you load a new CLI session this
file is read and any code inside it is executed. You might already have this
file, so make sure you don't overwrite it!</p>
<h2 id="bash-aliases-for-git">Bash aliases for git<a class="headerlink" href="#bash-aliases-for-git" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Some Git commands are used over and over again when working with git, such as
<code>git status</code>. Some people like to have aliases (<em>i.e.</em> shortcuts) for these
common commands. Here is a small list of such aliases that you may find useful
or, even better, might inspire you to create your own! Add them to your
<code>~/.bash_profile</code> as above, so that they're available across sessions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Basic git commands
alias gb='git branch'
alias ga='git add'
alias gd='git diff'
alias gcm='git commit'
alias gp='git push'
alias gu='git pull'
alias gm='git merge'
alias gco='git checkout'
alias gl='git log'

# Git status in short format
alias gst='git status -s'

# Add and commit all tracked and modified files
alias gca='git commit -a'

# Create and checkout a new branch
alias gcob='git checkout -b'

# Git log with one line per commit
alias glo='git log --oneline'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="forking">Forking<a class="headerlink" href="#forking" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>When you want to work on an Open Source project that is available on <em>e.g.</em>
GitHub, you usually don't have permission to directly push code to the project's
repository - this is so that the project's maintainers are the only ones that
can directly change anything in their codebase. How do you then contribute to
projects that don't allow you to push your code to their repository? Simple: use
<em>forking</em>!</p>
<p>Forking is when you make your own copy of a repository on your GitHub account,
which you will then have permissions to change as you see fit. You can then
create pull requests from your fork to the original repository, rather than
pushing code to a new branch and making a pull request from that. Working with
forks just adds an additional step to the whole workflow: instead of being
"clone; code and commit changes on a new branch; push branch to remote; pull
request from branch" it becomes "fork; clone; code and commit changes; push code
to fork; pull request from fork".</p>
<p>You might also want to do a fork of a project simply because you want to have
your own copy of it as well, without ever having the intention of changing it.
This is, of course, perfectly fine as well, but do keep in mind that developers
are usually quite happy to incorporate new changes from contributors if they are
reasonable and fulfil a purpose and add functionality to the project. It is
quite common that you have a use-case the maintainer didn't think of before, and
that you've helped the project grow by contributing your code!</p>
