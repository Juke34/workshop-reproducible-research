			<p>Now that we've gone through the specifics of executing workflows in a bit more
detail, let's go through working with processes. While there are numerous
process <em>directives</em> that can be used, we'll go through some of the more
commonly used ones here.</p>
<h1 id="tags">Tags<a class="headerlink" href="#tags" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Let's look at the command line output we got during the workflow's execution,
which should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">N E X T F L O W  ~  version 21.04.0

<p>Have you noticed that there are SRA IDs after some of the processes? Well, if
you look at which processes show these SRA IDs you might see that it's only
those processes that are executed three times, <em>i.e.</em> once per SRA ID. This
doesn't happen automatically, however, and comes from something called <em>tags</em>.
Let's look at the <code>GET_SRA_BY_ACCESSION</code> process:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nextflow">process GET_SRA_BY_ACCESSION {

    // Retrieve a single-read FASTQ file from SRA (Sequence Read Archive) by run
    // accession number.

    tag &quot;${sra_id}&quot;
    publishDir &quot;results/data/raw_internal&quot;,
        mode: &quot;copy&quot;

    input:
    val(sra_id)

    output:
    tuple val(sra_id), path(&quot;*.fastq.gz&quot;)

    script:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    fastq-dump ${sra_id} \
        -X 25000 \
        --readids \
        --dumpbase \
        --skip-technical \
        --gzip \
        -Z \
        &gt; ${sra_id}.fastq.gz
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can see the <code>tag</code> directive at the very top of the process definition. Tags
can be used to <em>e.g.</em> show information about the sample currently being analysed
by the process. This is useful both during run-time (allowing you to see which
sample is being processed) but also for debugging or finding problematic samples
in case of errors or odd output. There is, naturally, no need to use tags for
processes which are only run once.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Comment out (prefix with <code>//</code>) the <code>tag</code> directive from the <code>GET_SRA_BY_ACCESSION</code> process and run the
  workflow again. No more SRA IDs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncomment the <code>tag</code> directive before you move on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="named-outputs">Named outputs<a class="headerlink" href="#named-outputs" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Let's move on to the next process! It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nextflow">process RUN_FASTQC {

    // Run FastQC on a FASTQ file.

    tag &quot;${sample}&quot;
    publishDir &quot;results/&quot;, mode: &quot;copy&quot;

    input:
    tuple val(sample), path(fastq)

    output:
    path(&quot;*.html&quot;)
    path(&quot;*.zip&quot;)

    script:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # Run FastQC
    fastqc ${fastq} -q
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a process with two output channels! One contains all the <code>.html</code> files, while
the other contains all the <code>.zip</code> files. How is this handled in the workflow
definition of downstream processes that use the outputs? The <code>RUN_MULTIQC</code>
process uses this output, and its part in the workflow definition looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nextflow">RUN_MULTIQC (
    RUN_FASTQC.out[1].collect()
)
</code></pre>
<p>We already know about <code>.out</code> and <code>.collect()</code>, but we have something new here:
the <code>RUN_MULTIQC</code> process is taking the second channel of the output from the
<code>RUN_FASTQC</code> process - <code>[1]</code> is the index for the second channel, as Groovy is 
zero-based (the first channel is indexed by <code>[0]</code>).</p>
<p>This comes with some issues, however. What if
we accidentally changed the order of the outputs in the rule, or added a new
one? Using positions like this is easy to mess up, but there is a better
solution: named outputs! This can be achieved by adding the <code>emit</code> option for
some or all of the outputs, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nextflow">output:
path(*.txt), emit: text
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of referring to the output by its position in an array as previously, we
refer to the channel with a label we choose (<code>.out.text</code>) instead. This benefits us in that 
we can infer more information about channel contents called <code>text</code> rather than <code>[1]</code>, 
and it is also allows us to be less error-prone when rewriting parts of a workflow.</p>
<p>Your turn! Add named outputs to the <code>RUN_FASTQC</code> process and make <code>RUN_MULTIQC</code> 
use those outputs. You'll have to change both the output section of the 
<code>RUN_FASTQC</code> process, and the workflow definition section for <code>RUN_MULTIQC</code>.
If you need help, see the hint below.</p>

        path(&quot;*.html&quot;), emit: html
        path(&quot;*.zip&quot;),  emit: zip

<p>Check if it works by executing the workflow.</p>
<h1 id="advanced-publishing">Advanced publishing<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-publishing" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>So far we've only used the <code>publishDir</code> directive in a very simple way:
specifying a directory and the <code>mode</code> to use when publishing (to copy the files
rather than symbolically link them). There are more things you can do, however,
especially for processes with more than one output. For example, we
can publish outputs in separate directories, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nextflow">publishDir &quot;results/tables/&quot;,
    pattern: &quot;*.tsv&quot;,
    mode: &quot;copy&quot;
publishDir &quot;results/logs&quot;,
    pattern: &quot;*.log&quot;,
    mode: &quot;copy&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>*.tsv</code> files are copied to the folder <code>results/tables/</code>,
while <code>*.log</code> files are copied to the folder <code>results/logs</code>. The 
<code>publishDir</code> directive can be used multiple times in a single process, allowing
one to separate output as above, or publish the same output to multiple folders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the <code>RUN_FASTQC</code> process to place the HTML and compressed files in
  separate directories. Remove the <code>results</code> directory and re-run the workflow
  to check that it worked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that an output and a <em>published</em> output are different things: something can
be an output of a process without being published. In fact, the <code>RUN_FASTQC</code>
process is a prime example of this! Think about the compressed output: this
output is only used by the downstream process <code>RUN_MULTIQC</code> and is never meant
to be viewed by a human or used by a human in some downstream task not part of
the pipeline itself. We would thus like to keep the compressed files as an
output, but not publish said output. How do we do this? Just remove the
corresponding <code>publishDir</code> directive!</p>
<p>The MRSA workflow we've made here was refactored directly from its original
version in the Snakemake tutorial of this course, which means that its output
structure is not fully taking advantage of some of Nextflow's functionality.
The compressed output we've already talked about above is, for example, put in
the <code>results/intermediate/</code> directory. This is required for Snakemake, but not
so for Nextflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>See if you can find any other processes in the current implementation of the
  MRSA workflow that you could optimise like this!</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about whether all processes actually need to have published outputs. Make
sure you test executing the workflow after you've made any changes.</p>
<h1 id="debugging">Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>It is, sadly, inevitable that we all make mistakes while coding - nobody's
perfect! Nextflow helps you quite a bit when this happens, not just with its
logs but also with informative error messages. Let's introduce an error and look
at what we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the name of the <code>multiqc_general_stats.txt</code> output in the <code>RUN_MULTIQC</code>
  process to something different and re-run the workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>We got an error! We get a number of things, actually, including (in order from
the top) the name of the process that gave the error, the likely cause, the
command that was executed, along with its exit status, output, error and the
work directory that the task was run in. Let's focus on the <code>Caused by:</code> part,
which should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Caused by:
  Missing output file(s) `multiqc_general_stats.text` expected by process `RUN_MULTIQC`
</code></pre>
<p>We can also see that the command's exit status is <code>0</code>, which means that the
command was successful; any exit status other than <code>0</code> means there was an error
of some kind. We can thus infer that the command (1) worked, (2) failed to give
us the output expected by Nextflow. Thankfully, Nextflow graciously prints the
work directory for us so that we may check out what happened in more detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the working directory path, <code>cd</code> into it and list its contents using
  <code>ls</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might already have spotted the error in the message above! The error we
introduced here was that the expected output file has a <code>.text</code> extension,
rather than the correct <code>.txt</code>. Nextflow is expecting the <code>.text</code> output, but
the process <code>script</code> directive is (correctly) giving us the <code>.txt</code> file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go back to the root directory, revert the error you introduced and re-run the
  workflow to make sure it works again.</li>
</ul>
<p>This might have seemed like a trivial error, but a lot of errors in Nextflow can
be solved in the same manner, <em>i.e.</em> by just following the debugging output
reported by Nextflow and inspecting the specific subdirectory in question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A note about Bash</strong> <br>
If you are using Bash variables inside the <code>script</code> directive you have to be
careful to prepend it with a backslash, <em>e.g.</em> <code>\${BASH_VARIABLE}</code>. This is
because the dollar-sign is used by Nextflow, so you have to tell Nextflow
explicitly when you're using a Bash variable. This is a common source of
errors when using Bash variables, so keeping it in mind can save you some
debugging time!</p>
<p><strong>Quick recap</strong> <br>
In this section we've learnt:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use the <code>tag</code> directive</li>
<li>How to use named output</li>
<li>How to separate process outputs into different directories</li>
<li>How to debug errors and mistakes</li>
</ul>
